    <h1>Refund and Cancellation Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 26th December 2025</p>

    <p>Amaanitvam Foundation takes the utmost care to process donations as per the instructions given by our donors,
        online and offline. However, we recognize that there might be instances of erroneous donations or technical
        glitches.</p>

    <h2>1. General Policy</h2>
    <p>Donations made to Amaanitvam Foundation are generally <strong>non-refundable</strong>. As a charitable
        organization, we utilize the funds for our social welfare projects immediately. However, refunds may be
        considered in the following specific circumstances:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If a double transaction occurred due to a technical server error.</li>
        <li>If the donor entered the wrong amount (e.g., ₹10,000 instead of ₹1,000) and notifies us immediately.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Time Limit for Requests</h2>
    <p>If you wish to cancel your donation or request a refund, you must notify us within <strong>7 days</strong> of
        making the donation.</p>
    <p>Requests received after 7 days will not be entertained as the funds may have already been allocated to a project.
    </p>

    <h2>3. 80G Tax Exemption Receipts</h2>
    <div class="warning-box">
        <strong>Important:</strong> If a tax exemption certificate (Form 10BE / 80G Receipt) has already been issued for
        your donation, we will <strong>NOT</strong> be able to process a refund under any circumstances, as per
        Government of India tax laws.
    </div>
